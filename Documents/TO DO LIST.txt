Coding part

- make a default player stat graph that is static ( maybe nhl average values ) on the interface while 
	users are searching for a player ( so the player graph doesnt just appear out of no where ) 
- remake the whole interface layout and design to be more appealing ( CSS ) 
- make a filtering system or some other type of interface for the system
