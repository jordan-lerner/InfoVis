For Vis Implementation 

>>>>>> use points below to add features to the VIS for the DEMO

For Paper and presentation

1. What data types are is the system using ? chapter 1
table
static
categorical

2.What actions is the vis going ? chapter 2
consume - discover,present( i think present ) , enjoy ?
produce - annotate,record, derive ? ( i think none )?
search - (none right now) ?
query -  identify, compare, summarize?

3.what are the vis' targets ? chapter 2
all data - trends ( i think trends ) , outliers, features ?
attributes -distribution, dependency ,correlation, similarity ?

4.what display techniques does the vis use ? (page 58)
superimpose
aggregate ? group teams together ??
arrange data using ordering ? 

5.The KEY STUFF part 1( chapter 5 ) 
** Magnitude channels used 
we used positioning ( ranked #1 ) 

** Identity channels 
we used region[ once y axis becomes salary bottom right is best , top left is worst ] ( ranked #1 )
we used  colour ( ranked #2 )

we only use 4 bins ( 4 coloured divisions, 4 player positions ), only deal with one at a time 
	you have to finish with the 4 division before the players show up 
	
we use both positioning and hue to determine features about the data ( position + hue is considered , fully separable )

6. The KEY STUFF part 2 (chapter 6 )

no 3d because it is not justified 

title of where the user is in the navigation "reduces cognitive load" on the user (page 132)

no subtle changes in our vis, so there is no "change blindness" (page 133)

we built our navigation system based on Shneiderman's mantra overview->zoom and filter->details 
	Our vis uses this :overview( NHL) ,zoom and filter ( division ), details on demand ( scatterplot ) ( page 135 )
	
responsiveness principle, our vis takes < 1 second which is seen as immediate response (page 137)
